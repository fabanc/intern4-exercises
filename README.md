# Description

This repository contains a serie of exercises to be used in a tutorial to get people started with unit testing using intern 4 and Esri JavaScript API 4. The serie of excercises introduce you to the core concepts of Intern and then walk you to the point where you can use it with Esri JavaScript 4.x API.

- excercise 1: shows you how to create a basic unit test using intern, and run it from the command line, or in a browser.
- excercise 2: shows how to run multiple unit tests.
- excercise 3: shows how to use the dojo2 loader with intern. This loader will be required to work with Esri JavaScript 4.x API.
- excercise 4: show how to use Intern to test your custom widget code when developing with Esri JavaScript 4.x API.

# Resources

I have been doing that while learning how to use intern as well, so here are the list of resources that helped me to get started the most. The first set of resources are from Rene Rublava, from Esri Inc.

- His blog: https://odoe.net.
- His github account. Especially this repository: https://github.com/odoe/arcgis-cli-app

The second one is the documentation from the intern 4 developement team.
